# angular playground

This repository contains small projects I'm building while learning about Angular.


## contents  
- **Chat**  - contains simple chat application
- **Courses**   - contains crud operations implemented in simple asp.net core web api with angular 7. I've built a Web API project in Asp.Net Core (/ElectiveCourses) with the required methods at server side using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server as database storage. Then the Angular 7 Project (/ElectiveCoursesAngular) consumes those methods from the client side.
- **FirebaseGallery** - to be added  
- **observables-rxjs**  - will include mock up of my github profile all done using github's open api and bootstrap  

> **Note:** most of this code will be refactored
