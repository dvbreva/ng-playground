# angular playground

This repository contains small projects I'm building while learning about Angular.


## contents  
- **chat**  - contains simple chat application that is messenger like
- **uni-courses**   - contains crud operations implemented in simple asp.net core web api with angular 7. I've built a Web API project in Asp.Net Core (/ElectiveCourses) with the required methods at server side using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server as database storage. Then the Angular 7 Project (/ElectiveCoursesAngular) consumes those methods from the client side.
- **movie-catalog** - used the movie db open api, custom event emmitters and some filtering logic 
- **foot-court**  - simple app using angular's in memory web api to implement Redux pattern; basic NgRx and Bootstrap exercise

> **Note:** most of this code will be refactored
